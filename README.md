```
rps-game
 ├── public
 ├── src
 ├── README.md
 └── tailwind.config.js
```

### Step 1: Setup Project Folder
- Create a folder named `rps-game` (or any name you prefer) and open it in a code editor like VS` Code`.
- Open the `terminal/command` prompt inside the folder and run the following command to set up the `React app`:
```bash
-> npx create-react-app frontend
``` 
This will create a frontend folder with the basic React project setup.

### Step 2: Navigate to the frontend folder
```bash
-> cd frontend
```
### Step 3: Install Required Dependency
Inside the `rps-game` folder, install the necessary dependencies for the project:
```bash
-> npm install -D tailwindcss@3
-> npm init tailwind
```

### Step 4: Replace the Default `src` and `public` Folders
1. Inside the `rps-game` folder, you will find a `src` and `public` folders that was created by create-react-app. You need to replace these `src` and `public` folders with the `src` and `public` folders from the project you downloaded.

2. Delete the existing `src` and `public` folders inside `rps-game`, and then copy the `src` and `public` folders from your downloaded project into the rps-game folder.

### Step 5: Run the React App
Now you can start the React development server and view the app in your browser.
```bash
-> npm start
```
This will start the app at http://localhost:3000 by default.
